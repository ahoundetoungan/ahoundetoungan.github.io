    <h2> Welcome to my Blog! </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p> This blog covers topics related to programming that can be useful in economics, statistic or finance.
      I created this page because I love programming. The content of this page are either for real projects or just
      for fun. My favorite software is <strong>R</strong> but I usually write my codes (for intensive computations)
      using <strong>R</strong>  and <strong>C++</strong> together. I often build <strong>R</strong> packages for my research papers which develop new methods/models.
      My latest packages include <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan/PartialNetwork">PartialNetwork</a> (with <a href="https://www.vincentbouchereconomist.com/">Vincent Boucher</a>)
      which aims to estimate peer effect models with partial network data and <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan/CDatanet">CDatanet</a>
      for estimating a count data model with social interactions (this package is related to my job market paper). Before starting research, I was a statistician engineer with
      high interest in <strong>Statistical Analysis Software</strong> (SAS). You can find my <strong>SAS</strong> macros on <a href="https://www.developpez.net/forums/u760090/haache/">the developers club and IT Pro website</a>. This blog
      contains more recent and complete work. You can also visit my <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan">GitHub page</a> for more ressources.</p>
