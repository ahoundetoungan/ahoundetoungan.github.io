  <p>My research is mainly focused on the econometrics of social networks and the financial econometrics. In particular, I am interested in methods for networks.
	  In my Job market paper, I examine a social interactions model for count data. This model generalizes the rational expectation model of
	  <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00401" target="_blank">Lee et al. (2014)</a> for binary outcome, and allows the dependent
	  variable to take an unlimited number of possibilities. The model can be used to analyze peer effect on the number of occurrences of an event
	  in a constant period (e.g., the number of cigarettes smoked, the number of times people eat fast food, go to the gym, etc.). In another paper,
	  a joint work with <a href="https://www.vincentbouchereconomist.com/" target="_blank">Vincent Boucher</a>, we propose a new method for estimating peer effect
	  by releasing the common assumption that the network is entirely observed or measured without errors. This is better suited to networks
	  constructed from survey data. Lastly, one of my papers (<span style="color: blue;">Accepted in Journal of Financial Econometrics</span>) with
	  <a href="https://arnauddufays.com/" target="_blank">Arnaud Dufays</a> and <a href="https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/coen.alain/" target="_blank">Alain Coen</a>,
	  uses a variables selection method to detect relevant changes in the parameters of linear-in-mean autoregressive (AR and ARX) models for
	  time series subject to multiple structural breaks. </p>

	    <p>I use an incomplete information network game to  examine a peer effect model in which, outcome takes integer values. Players simultaneously choose
	    their strategy and get payoff by forming rational belief about the distribution of their peers' strategy. I find sufficient conditions under
	    which the game equilibrium is unique. I also prove that  the model generalizes <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00401" target="_blank">Lee et al. (2014)</a>.
	    The model parameters can be estimated using
	    the Nested Partial Likelihood method. The limit distribution of the estimator is studied. In terms of dispersion fitting, the model is more flexible
	    than most standard count data models. As empirical application, I study peer effect on the number of extracurricular activities in which students
	    are enrolled. In this empirical exercise, I control for the network endogeneity.

    <p>We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not observe the network structure. Instead, we assume that researchers know (have a consistent
      estimate of) the distribution of the network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for the estimation of peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We present and discuss important
      examples where our methodology can be applied. In particular, we provide an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students’ academic achievement.</p>
