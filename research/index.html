	    <p>I propose a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I present sufficient conditions under which the game equilibrium is unique and study the model parameter identification. My identification result is general and can be applied to other nonlinear models with social interactions, such as binary and ordered response models. I show that the parameters can be estimated using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NLP). I generalize the estimator to the case of endogenous networks and study its asymptotic properties. I show that the linear-in-means/Tobit models with a counting outcome are particular cases of my model. However, these models ignore the counting nature of the dependent variable and lead to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate  peer effects on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that increasing the expected number of activities in which a student's friends are enrolled by one implies an increase in the expected number of activities in which the student is enrolled by 0.08. The estimate of this effect with the Tobit model is three times higher.

    <p>We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored networks, misclassified links, and aggregated relational data. We assume that researchers can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students academic achievement using the widely used Add Health database and show that network data errors have a first-order downward bias on estimated peer effects.

    <li>Identifying peer effects on academic achievements through students' effort (<i>with Cristelle Kouame</i>) - Draft coming soon</li>
    <p> We propose a structural model to study peer effects on students' academic efforts accounting for unobserved school heterogeneity. We assume that students cannot directly control their academic achievement, but instead, they can choose how much effort they put in, which affects their grade point average (GPA). Previous studies have often directly accounted for peer influence on GPA. The reason why students' GPA can be affected by that of their peers is that effort plays a critical role in determining GPA. However, we show that this approach underestimates peer effects. Our model leads to a new econometric specification to consistently estimate peer effects on academic effort. We provide a rigorous identification strategy that combines the general method of moment and quasi-maximum likelihood approaches. We also extend our analysis to examine cases where the network is endogenous. An empirical analysis using Add Health data shows that the peer effect estimate obtained using standard models is 1.6 times lower than that obtained from our proposed approach. Controlling for network endogeneity in the standard model reduces the bias.</p>
