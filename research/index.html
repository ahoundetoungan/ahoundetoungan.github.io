      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Count Data Models with Heterogeneous Peer Effects under Rational Expectations</b>, May 2024  <em style="color:#6600FF">(R&R at the Journal of Applied Econometrics)</em></p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">
        This paper develops a micro-founded peer effect model for count responses using a game of incomplete information. The model incorporates heterogeneity in peer effects through agents' groups based on observed characteristics. Parameter identification is established using the identification condition of linear models, which relies on the presence of friends' friends who are not direct friends in the network. I show that this condition extends to a large class of nonlinear models. The model parameters are estimated using the nested pseudo-likelihood approach, controlling for network endogeneity. I present an empirical application on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that females are more responsive to their peers than males, whereas male peers do not influence male students. An easy-to-use R package—named CDatanet—is available for implementing the model.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">Peer influence on effort devoted to some activity is often studied using proxy variables when actual effort is unobserved. For instance, in education, academic effort is often proxied by GPA. We propose an alternative approach that circumvents this approximation. Our framework distinguishes unobserved shocks to GPA that do not affect effort from preference shocks that do affect effort levels. We show that peer effects estimates obtained using our approach can differ significantly from classical estimates (where effort is approximated) if the network includes isolated students. Applying our approach to data on high school students in the United States, we find that peer effect estimates relying on GPA as a proxy for effort are 40\% lower than those obtained using our approach.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Inference for Two-Stage Extremum Estimators</b>, February 2024 - with Abdoul Haki Maoude <em style="color:#6600FF"></em></p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">We present a simulation-based approach to approximate the asymptotic variance and asymptotic distribution function of two-stage estimators. We focus on extremum estimators in the second stage and consider a large class of estimators in the first stage. This class includes extremum estimators, high-dimensional estimators, and other types of estimators (e.g., Bayesian estimators). We accommodate scenarios where the asymptotic distributions of both the first- and second-stage estimators are non-normal. We also allow for the second-stage estimator to exhibit a significant bias due to the first-stage sampling error. We introduce a debiased plug-in estimator and establish its limiting distribution. Our method is readily implementable with complex models.  Unlike resampling methods, we eliminate the need for multiple computations of the plug-in estimator. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the effectiveness of our approach in finite samples. We present an empirical application with peer effects on adolescent fast-food consumption habits, where we employ the proposed method to address the issue of biased instrumental variable estimates resulting from the presence of many weak instruments.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b> Quantile Peer Effect Models</b>, May 2025</p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif"> I propose a flexible structural model to estimate peer effects across various quantiles of the peer outcome distribution. The model allows peers with low, intermediate, and high outcomes to exert distinct influences, thereby capturing more nuanced patterns of peer effects than standard approaches that are based on aggregate measures. I establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and demonstrate that the model parameters can be estimated using a straightforward instrumental variable strategy. Applying the model to a range of outcomes that are commonly studied in the literature, I uncover diverse and rich patterns of peer influences that challenge assumptions inherent in standard models. These findings carry important policy implications: key player status in a network depends not only on network structure, but also on the distribution of outcomes within the population.</p>

    <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif"> We analyze the impact of a large-scale desegregation program on friendship networks in middle schools. We first document significant homophily with respect to socio-economic status in Control schools. We then assess the effect of the program on friendship networks. We find that status homophily is higher in Treated schools, which have more diverse student populations. Both baseline homophily and the increase in homophily due to the treatment reduce the effectiveness of the program in fostering more diverse friendships. We propose a novel decomposition of the Treatment effect into a composition and a homophily effect, and we develop a new methodology to account for censoring in the econometrics of network formation.</p>
