	    <p>I propose a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I present sufficient conditions under which the game equilibrium is unique and study the model parameter identification. My identification result is general and can be applied to other nonlinear models with social interactions, such as binary and ordered response models. I show that the parameters can be estimated using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NLP). I generalize the estimator to the case of endogenous networks and study its asymptotic properties. I show that the linear-in-means/Tobit models with a counting outcome are particular cases of my model. However, these models ignore the counting nature of the dependent variable and lead to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate  peer effects on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that increasing the expected number of activities in which a student's friends are enrolled by one implies an increase in the expected number of activities in which the student is enrolled by 0.08. The estimate of this effect with the Tobit model is three times higher.

    <p>We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored networks, misclassified links, and aggregated relational data. We assume that researchers can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students academic achievement using the widely used Add Health database and show that network data errors have a first-order downward bias on estimated peer effects.

    <li><b>Identifying peer effects on academic achievement through students' effort, 2023</b> (with Cristelle Kouame) - Draft available upon request
    <p> We propose a structural model to study peer effects on students' academic achievement. We assume that peer influences take root in students' efforts and not in academic achievement. This is supported by the fact that students cannot directly control their academic achievement, but instead, they can choose how much effort they put in. The proposed model leads to a new econometric specification and we show that peer influences estimated using classical models may be biased when the network comprises students without friends. We propose a rigorous identification strategy for the model combining the general method of moments (GMM) and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) approaches. We also extend our analysis to examine cases where the network is endogenous. An empirical analysis using Add Health data shows that the peer effect estimate obtained using a standard linear-in-means model is 1.6 times lower than that obtained from our proposed approach. Controlling for network endogeneity in the standard model reduces the bias.</p></li>

    <li>Inference for Sequential Conditional M-estimators (with Abdoul Haki Maoude)</li>
    <p> Multiple-stage estimation is a widely used technique in econometrics to handle issues such as endogeneity, missing data, and latent variables. This approach involves estimating controls, which are then plugged into a model that can be estimated using conventional methods. The asymptotic properties of the resulting "plug-in" estimator are of interest for hypothesis tests and can be difficult to determine as they depend on the precision of the control estimator. We examine these properties for a general class of control estimators when the final-stage estimator is an M-estimator. Our approach allows for the use of Bayesian or nonparametric estimators for the controls. We introduce a simple simulation method to approximate the variance and distribution of the plug-in estimator, taking into account the uncertainty of the control estimates. Our method can be easily applied to complex models as we do not compute the plug-in estimator on several subsamples, as is required in the Bootstrap approach. We applied the method to an auction model to study bidder behavior in the weekly open market operations conducted by the Central Bank of West African States.</p>
