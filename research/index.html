        This paper proposes a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I show that the game has a unique equilibrium under standard conditions. I also demonstrate that the identification argument in Bramoullé et al. (2009) extends to nonlinear models, particularly to the model of this paper. The model parameters are estimated using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NPL) approach, controlling for network endogeneity. I how that the linear-in-means/Tobit models with a counting outcome are particular cases of my model. However, by ignoring the counting nature of the outcome, these models can lead to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate peer effects on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that a one-unit increase in the expected number of activities in which a student's friends are enrolled yields an increase in the expected number of activities in which the student is enrolled by 0.08. This point estimate using the Tobit model is three times higher.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Estimating Peer Effects using Partial Network Data, 2023</b> - with Vincent Boucher <!--<em style="color:#6600FF">(Submitted)</em>--></p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored networks, misclassified links, and aggregated relational data. We assume that researchers can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students academic achievement using the widely used Add Health database and show that network data errors have a first-order downward bias on estimated peer effects.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Healthcare Quality by Specialists under a Mixed Compensation System: an Empirical Analysis, 2023</b> - whith Damien Echevin and Bernard Fortin</p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">We analyze the effects of a mixed compensation (MC) scheme for specialists on the quality of their healthcare services. To do so, we exploit a major reform that was implemented in Quebec (Canada) in 1999. The government introduced a payment mechanism combining a fixed <e>per diem</e> with a reduced fee per clinical service. Using panel patient-doctor data covering the period 1996-2016 and including 320,441 patients, we estimate a multi-state multi-spell hazard model with correlated heterogeneity, analogous to a difference-in-differences approach. We compute three output-based quality indicators from our model. Our results suggest that the reform reduced the quality of MC specialist services as measured by the risk of re-hospitalization within 30 days after discharge and the risk of mortality within one year after discharge. These effects vary depending upon the specialty of the treating doctor.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Identifying Peer Effects on Student Academic Effort, 2023</b> - with Cristelle Kouame <!--<em style="color:#6600FF">(Submitted)</em>--></p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">Peer influences on students' academic effort are often studied using GPA as a proxy variable for the effort when the latter is unobserved. We present an alternative method that does not require this approximation. Our identification strategy distinguishes unobserved shocks exerted on GPA without influencing the effort from unobserved students' preference shocks. We find that our estimate may be significantly different from the classical estimate (where the effort is approximated) if the network includes isolated students. Applying our approach to Add Health data shows that the peer effect estimate using a proxy for the effort is 1.6 times lower.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif"> We present a simulation-based approach to approximate the asymptotic variance and asymptotic distribution function of two-stage estimators. We focus on extremum estimators in the second stage and consider a large class of estimators in the first stage. This class includes extremum estimators, high-dimensional estimators, and other types of estimators (e.g., Bayesian estimators). Importantly, the asymptotic distributions of both the first- and second-stage estimators may not be normal. Unlike resampling methods, our approach does not require multiple computations of the plug-in estimator. We show the effectiveness of our method using numerical simulations and empirical applications on real data.</p>
