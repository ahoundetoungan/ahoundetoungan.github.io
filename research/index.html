	    <p>I propose a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I present sufficient conditions under which the game equilibrium is unique and study the model parameter identification. My identification result is general and can be applied to other nonlinear models with social interactions, such as binary and ordered response models. I show that the parameters can be estimated using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NLP). I generalize the estimator to the case of endogenous networks and study its asymptotic properties. I show that the linear-in-means/Tobit models with a counting outcome are particular cases of my model. However, these models ignore the counting nature of the dependent variable and lead to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate  peer effects on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that increasing the expected number of activities in which a student's friends are enrolled by one implies an increase in the expected number of activities in which the student is enrolled by 0.08. The estimate of this effect with the Tobit model is three times higher.

    <p>We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not
observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored
networks, misclassified links, and aggregated relational data. We assume that researchers
can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this
assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide
an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students academic achievement using
the widely used Add Health database and show that network data errors have a first-order
downward bias on estimated peer effects.
