	    <p>I propose a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I provide sufficient conditions under which the game equilibrium is unique and estimate the model parameters using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NLP) approach. I generalize the NPL estimator to the case of endogenous networks and establish its asymptotic properties. I show that estimating peer effects on counting variables using models that ignore the counting nature of the outcome, such as the Tobit model, leads to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate peer effects on students’ participation in extracurricular activities.

    <p>We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not
observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored
networks, misclassified links, and aggregated relational data. We assume that researchers
can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this
assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide
an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students academic achievement using
the widely used Add Health database and show that network data errors have a first-order
downward bias on estimated peer effects.
