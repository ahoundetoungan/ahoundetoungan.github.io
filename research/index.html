      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Identifying Peer Effects on Student Academic Effort, 2023</b> (with Cristelle Kouame)</p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">Peer influences on academic outcomes are often studied using GPA as a proxy variable for students' academic effort. We show that this may bias the peer effects when the network includes isolated students. This is because GPA depends on unobserved factors that do not influence isolated and non-isolated students  in the same way. To resolve this issue, we propose an identification strategy that distinguishes unobserved shocks exerted on GPA without influencing the effort from unobserved students' preference shocks. Applying our approach to Add Health data shows that the peer effect estimate using standard approaches is biased downward.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Estimating Peer Effects using Partial Network Data, 2023</b> (with Vincent Boucher)</p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored networks, misclassified links, and aggregated relational data. We assume that researchers can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students academic achievement using the widely used Add Health database and show that network data errors have a first-order downward bias on estimated peer effects.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Count Data Models with Social Interactions under Rational Expectations, 2022</b> <em style="color:#6600FF">(R&R to the Journal of Econometrics)</em></p>
      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">I propose a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I present sufficient conditions under which the game equilibrium is unique and study the model parameter identification. My identification result is general and can be applied to other nonlinear models with social interactions, such as binary and ordered response models. I show that the parameters can be estimated using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NLP). I generalize the estimator to the case of endogenous networks and study its asymptotic properties. I show that the linear-in-means/Tobit models with a counting outcome are particular cases of my model. However, these models ignore the counting nature of the dependent variable and lead to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate  peer effects on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that increasing the expected number of activities in which a student's friends are enrolled by one implies an increase in the expected number of activities in which the student is enrolled by 0.08. The estimate of this effect with the Tobit model is three times higher.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter">Inference for Sequential Conditional M-estimators (with Abdoul Haki Maoude)</p>
      <p class="nomarginbefore descriptif"> Two-stage estimation is a widely used technique in econometrics to tackle issues such as endogeneity, non-identification, and missing values. This approach involves estimating a control, which is then plugged into a model that can be estimated using conventional methods. The asymptotic properties of the resulting <i>plug-in</i> (or <i>two-stage</i>) estimator are of interest for hypothesis tests. We study these properties for a large class of control estimators when the plug-in estimator is an M-estimator. Our approach allows for the use of Bayesian or nonparametric estimators for the controls. We propose a simple simulation method to approximate the variance and distribution of the plug-in estimator, taking into account the sampling error of the control estimate. Our method can be easily applied to complex models as we do not compute the control and plug-in estimators on several subsamples, as is required in the Bootstrap approach.</p>
