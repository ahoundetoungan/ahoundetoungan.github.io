      I am an economist at <a href="https://thema.u-cergy.fr/?lang=en" target="_blank">Thema</a> and <a href="https://www.cyu.fr/english-version" target="_blank">CY Cergy Paris Université</a>. My research interests are in the fields of econometrics, social interactions and networks, and health economics.
      <br/><br/>
      Specifically, I am working on topics related to inference and bias reduction approaches for multiple-stage estimators. I am also studying new approaches for estimating peer effects that extend beyond classical linear models, including cases where the network is endogenous and limited data are available.
      To make my methods and models more accessible, I often provide R packages that enable practitioners to directly apply these methods to data. For more detailed information, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan">GitHub</a> and <a href="/software">Software</a> pages.
      <br/><br/>
      From an applied perspective, my research covers topics on social interactions, networks, and health economics. On the one hand, I try to better understand how individuals, particularly students, form their networks and how these networks influence their choices and behavior at school.
      On the other hand, I study issues related to health care quality and physicians' responses to payment shocks.
      <br/><br/>
      Beyond my research, I have a deep passion for emerging technologies, which has greatly fueled my love for programming.
      C++ is my favorite language, and it is also the most used language in my research.
