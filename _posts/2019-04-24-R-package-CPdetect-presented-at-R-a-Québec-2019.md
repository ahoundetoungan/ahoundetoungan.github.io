[Arnaud Dufay](https://arnauddufays.com/) and I built an R package, named **CPdetect** to detect relevant changes in AR and ARX models. The package will be very soon available online. I presented the package at the last conference of R  at Quebec city [[slides (in french)](https://ahoundetoungan.github.io/files/RQC2019/RQC2019_beamer.pdf)].
