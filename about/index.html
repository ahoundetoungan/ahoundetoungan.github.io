      <p>My research interests are in the fields of Econometrics, Social Networks and Applied Microeconomics. In particular, I am interested in methods for networks.
      In my Job market paper, I develop a peer effects models for count data. Peer effects on count data are generally
      estimated using a linear-in-means model which assumes that the dependent variable is continuous. I show that the
      counting nature of the dependent variable is important and assuming it is continuous underestimates the peer effects. The model can be used to estimate peer effects on the number of occurrences of an event
      in a constant period (e.g., the number of cigarettes smoked, the number of times people eat fast food, go to the gym, etc.). In another paper,
      a joint work with <a href="https://www.vincentbouchereconomist.com/" target="_blank">Vincent Boucher</a>, we propose a new method for estimating peer effects
      by releasing the common assumption that the network is entirely observed or measured without errors. This is better suited to networks
      constructed from survey data. Lastly, one of my papers (<span style="color: blue;">Accepted in Journal of Financial Econometrics</span>) with
      <a href="https://arnauddufays.com/" target="_blank">Arnaud Dufays</a> and <a href="https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/coen.alain/" target="_blank">Alain Coen</a>,
      uses a variables selection method to detect relevant changes in the parameters of linear-in-mean autoregressive (AR and ARX) models for
      time series subject to multiple structural breaks. </p>
