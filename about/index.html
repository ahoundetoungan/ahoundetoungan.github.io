    My research agenda encompasses several areas, including econometrics, social interactions and networks, education, and health economics.
    <br/><br/>
    Specifically, I am working on topics related to inference and bias reduction. I am also studying new approaches for estimating peer effects that extend beyond classical linear models, including cases where the network is endogenous and partially observed.
    To make my methods and models more accessible, I often provide R packages that enable practitioners to directly apply these methods to data. For more detailed information, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan">GitHub</a> and <a href="/software">Software</a> pages.
    <br/><br/>
    From an applied perspective, my research aims to better understand how individuals, particularly students, form their networks and how these networks influence their choices and behavior at school. In health economics, I study issues related to health care quality, including how physicians respond to payment shocks.
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond my research, I have a deep passion for emerging technologies, which has greatly fueled my love for programming.
    C++ is my favorite language, and it is also the most used language in my research. On the artistic side, I have over 15 years experience in music, specializing in guitar, piano, and arrangement.
