    My current research agenda includes topics in theoretical econometrics, social interactions and networks, and health economics.
    <br/><br/>
    Specifically, I am studying the inference of multi-stage estimators when regulatory conditions for asymptotic normality are violated. I am also working on new approaches to estimate peer effects that extend beyond linear models, inducing when the network is only partially observed.
    To make my methods and models more accessible, I often provide R packages that enable practitioners to directly apply these methods to their own data. For more detailed information, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan">GitHub</a> and <a href="/software">Software</a> pages.
    <br/><br/>
    From an applied standpoint, my research aims to gain insights into how individuals form their networks and how these networks influence their choice and behaviour. In health economics, I am studying issues related to the quality of health care in Canada.
    <br/><br/>
    Apart from research, I have a strong passion for new technology, which has fueled my love for programming.
    C++ is my favorite language (it is also the most used langage in my research). On the artistic side, I have over 15 years of musical experience. I mainly play Guitar and piano. I also possess skills in musical arrangement.
