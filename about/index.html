    My research agenda encompasses several areas, including econometrics, social interactions and networks, education, and health economics.
    <br/><br/>
    Specifically, I am working on inference and bias reduction related topics. I am also studying new approaches to estimate peer effects that extend beyond classical linear models, including cases where the network is endogenous and partially observed.
    To make my methods and models more accessible, I often provide R packages that enable practitioners to directly apply these methods to data. For more detailed information, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan">GitHub</a> and <a href="/software">Software</a> pages.
    <br/><br/>
    From an applied standpoint, my research aims to gain insights into how individuals form their networks and how these networks influence their choice and behaviour. In health economics, I am studying issues related to the quality of health care and physician payment in Canada.
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond my research, I have a deep passion for emerging technologies, which has greatly fueled my love for programming.
    C++ is my favorite language, and it is also the most used language in my research. On the artistic side, I have over 15 years experience in music, specializing in guitar, piano, and arrangement.
