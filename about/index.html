    My current research agenda encompasses several areas, including theoretical econometrics, social interactions and networks, and health economics.
    <br/><br/>
    Currently, I am studying inference of multi-stage estimators when regularity conditions for asymptotic normality are violated. I am also working on new approaches to estimate peer effects that extend beyond classical linear models, inducing when the network is endogenous, and partially observed.
    To make my methods and models more accessible, I often provide R packages that enable practitioners to directly apply these methods to their own data. For more detailed information, please visit my <a href="https://github.com/ahoundetoungan">GitHub</a> and <a href="/software">Software</a> pages.
    <br/><br/>
    From an applied standpoint, my research aims to gain insights into how individuals form their networks and how these networks influence their choice and behaviour. In health economics, I am studying issues related to the quality of health care and Physician payment in Canada.
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond my research, I have a deep passion for emerging technologies, which has greatly fueled my love for programming.
    C++ is my favorite language (it is also the most used langage in my research). On the artistic side, I have over 15 years of musical experience, specializing in guitar, piano, and musical arrangement.
